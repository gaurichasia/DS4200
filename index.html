    <h3>A little more about me!</h3>
    <p class = 'A'> Hi! My name is Gauri Chasia and I am a third year studying Data Science and Math! 
        I am very interested in Machine Learning and data analysis and want to pursue research 
        after completing undergrad. A few of my passions outside of school include reading mystery books, 
        learning new things about astronomy, and also listening to music. My favorite authors in the 
        mystery genre right now are Freida Mccfaden and Riley Sager. Their books are very fun to read and 
        have amazing plot twists every single time! I recently started a research project about astronomy and am very 
        interested specifically in exoplanets. I want to continue to analyze features about exoplanets so we can find 
        the exoplanets that closely resemble Earth. Finally, I like listening to various Kpop groups such as BTS and 
        Blackpink to name a few. Other than that I like to try new cafes and restaurants around Boston and hangout 
        with my friends. My favorite thing to do is go out to eat dinner with a few close friends and then wrap up 
        the night by going on a long night walk around campus. Some other classes I am taking this semester include 
        Fourier Series and PDEâ€™s, Machine Learning and Data Mining 1, and Database Design.
