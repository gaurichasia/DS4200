    <h3>Things to know about me! </h3>
    <p class = "A">In this HTML page I have included a picture of the new girl group that has just debuted that go by the name 
        Katseye and on the homepage I have included a picture of the famous boy band BTS. These are two groups that 
        I really enjoy listening to. I have watched the Katseye documentary on Netflix that went through the journey 
        of how Katseye came to be and showed all of the hard work it took for the girls to get to where they are at 
        right now. It was really interesting seeing how much hard work the girls put in to get into the group and also 
        how stressful it got when eliminations were happening. In the list below I have included some of my favorite bands 
        that I love to listen to in my free time! I love watching new music videos and am interested in finding new groups 
        to listen to. Other than my favorite groups I have also included Aya Nakamura who is probably my favorite solo artist. 
        All of her songs are in French and she recently opened for the Olympics. She is in fact the biggest artist in France 
        right now! I have been listening to her music for the last three years and have become a huge fan of hers.
